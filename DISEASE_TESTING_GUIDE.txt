Expected Results: Malaria, Dengue, Typhoid (high probabilities)

SCENARIO 3: Neurological Condition
Symptoms: Headache (Severe), Dizziness (Moderate), Fatigue (Moderate)

SCENARIO 4: Gastrointestinal Issue
Symptoms: Nausea (Severe), Fatigue (Moderate), Fever (Mild)

================================================================================
                                TESTING TIPS
================================================================================

1. Start with single symptoms to see baseline probabilities
2. Add more symptoms to see how probabilities change
3. Test edge cases with unusual symptom combinations
4. Verify that probabilities sum to 100% across all diseases
5. Check that the most likely disease makes medical sense
6. Test with no symptoms (should show equal probabilities)

================================================================================
                                EXPECTED BEHAVIORS
================================================================================

✓ Probabilities should always sum to 100%
✓ More specific symptoms should increase accuracy
✓ Severe symptoms should have stronger impact than mild ones
✓ Related symptoms should reinforce disease probabilities
✓ Unrelated symptoms should not significantly affect results
✓ The system should handle missing symptoms gracefully

================================================================================
                                TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that the Flask backend is running on port 5000
2. Verify all symptoms are spelled exactly as shown above
3. Ensure severity levels are exactly: None, Mild, Moderate, or Severe
4. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
5. Verify the API response format matches expected structure
